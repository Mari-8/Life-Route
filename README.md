# Life-Route
Welcome to Life Route! This is a Sinatra based application, built to help you set goals and stick to them. You will be able to create long, mid, or short term goals and then create the routine(s) you need to crush your goals! Create, practice, and stick to new habits as you fill your routine. 

The best way for anyone to achieve goals is to have clear, laid out plans on how they are going to achieve them. That is exactly what this app enables you to do. 
Set up your goals, routines, and habits and begin your Life Route today!
